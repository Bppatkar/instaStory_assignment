# Task

Develop a simplified version of the Instagram Stories feature. This application should allow users to view a series of "stories" - short, temporary posts that disappear after a set period (for the purposes of this assignment, the disappearance logic does not need to be implemented). The focus will be on the user interface and interaction, rather than backend logic or persistence.

## Features

### Mobile Only

Build this only for mobile and not desktop.

### Story List

A list of stories (only images) should be visible in a smaller view in a horizontally scrollable list.

### Fetching Stories

Fetch the list of stories from an external file.

### Navigation

User should be able to start viewing one of the available stories from list.

The user should be able to manually navigate between stories using UI controls.

Tapping on the left side of an open story should take the user to the previous story.

Tapping on the right side of an open story should take the user to the next story.

### Auto Advance

Stories should automatically advance to the next one after 5 seconds.

The loading states should be handled properly.

### Optional

Use transitions for smoother story viewing.
